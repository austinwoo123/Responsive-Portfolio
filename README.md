# Responsive Portfolio
This project was about creating a mobile responsive portfolio using bootstrap CSS framework. We needed to have a navbar, a resonsive layout, and responsive images. It needed to render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 

## Getting Started
1. Copy the repo from GitLab using your ssh key
2. Run Git bash
3. Type in "code ." to open Visual Studios Code
4. Open the index.html and style.css file

## Technologies Used
- HTML -used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS- styles html elements on page
- Git- version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub- hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages
- BootStrap CSS Framework- Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites using front-end open source toolkit, featuring SASS variables and mixins, responsive grid system, and prebuilt components.

## Code Snippet

```
 <div class="collapse navbar-collapse justify-content-end" id="navbarNav">
          <ul class="navbar-nav navlinks">
            <li class="nav-item">
```
This code shows how I adjusted the navbar contents: "about, contact, and portfolio" to the right of the page by adding "justify-content-end" after the div class.

```
<div class="container mt-5">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h1 class="card-header">Portfolio</h1>
```
This code shows how I used bootstrap's card component to format each of my about, contact, and portfolio pages.
